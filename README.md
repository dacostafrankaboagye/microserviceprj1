### confuguring the eureka server
ðŸŸ¨ What is Eureka Server?
  - Eureka Server is like a phone book for your microservices.
  - It keeps track of all your microservices: who they are, where they live (IP & port), and whether they're running.
  - Other services can register themselves with Eureka.
  - Services can also ask Eureka for the location of other services.
- This allows microservices to find and talk to each other without hardcoding IP addresses

- simple flow

- Note 
  - The settings register-with-eureka: false and fetch-registry: false are 
  - particularly important because they prevent the server from 
  - trying to register with itself and attempting to fetch the 
  - registry, which is necessary when running a standalone Eureka server.
